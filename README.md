# Faulty Payslips (Summer 2019)
This project had for goal to use machine learning tools to identify faulty payslips. The payslips used as data were emmitted in France, recurring monthly, and labeled as faulty if marked as edited by the accountant. This repository only contains one Jupiter Notebook, Payslip.ipynb, which includes the data pre-processing, cleaning, aggregating, and modeling. Most of the work consisted of reading in the payslips and formatting them to build a dataframe as their structure is constantly changing and comes as nested objects. The main challenges of this project was to identify and aggregate the most useful pieces of information, which was mostly done with domain knowledge, and the little amount of faulty payslips present in the dataset. A few classic supervised models were run towards the end of the project to evaluate the initial performance and, even though accuracy was very high, precision for the faulty label was low which means our goal was not met at that time. The project has now been passed on to a full-time data scientist at the firm.
